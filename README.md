Active Directory Bulk User Creator (ABDUC)

ABDUC is a PowerShell-based Windows Forms application aimed at reducing the tediousness of provisioning users in Active Directory.
The purpose is the ability to create multiple users and ultimately edit all user attributes before object creation.

Features:
- Creation of multiple AD user objects in a grid-like application
- Basic input validation
- Ability to add basic AD user object attributes
- Saving/loading header presets
- Importing data from CSV (currently only applies to "textbox" columns)
